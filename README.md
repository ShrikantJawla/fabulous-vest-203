## ðŸš€ About Me And This Project
Hi, My name is Shrikant, I'm currently studing in Masai School, learning full stack development and this project was built by me in cunstruct week to put all the skills in practice.
This is the clone of ZoomCar and and I have improved the UI of some of the parts as there was in real website.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Html, CSS, Styled-Components, Chakra-UI, Framer-Motion, Firebase 


## Lessons Learned

While I was creating this project I faced problem in performing all the CRUD operations in profile section.
- In profile section if any user login on the website it displays the use info and best part is user can update his/her info and 
  next time when user logs in again he will get all the last updated info on profile page as I am saving and updating the data directly on server just to imitate real functionality of updating profile of the users.

- Included the animations while user change the page and even some parts of pages itself.

- I learned several functions of Firebase while I was building this project.

- Learned Styled-components, Chakra-UI, React-router-dom and some other libraries.
