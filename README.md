You can see location on map while filling the input box, I wanted to also use pick up functionality on map but google has made that api paid now.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Html, CSS, Styled-Components, Chakra-UI, Framer-Motion, Firebase 


## Lessons Learned

While I was creating this project I faced problem in performing all the CRUD operations in profile section.
- In profile section if any user login on the website it displays the use info and best part is user can update his/her info and 
  next time when user logs in again he will get all the last updated info on profile page as I am saving and updating the data directly on server just to imitate real functionality of updating profile of the users.

- Included the animations while user change the page and even some parts of pages itself.

- I learned several functions of Firebase while I was building this project.

- Learned Styled-components, Chakra-UI, React-router-dom and some other libraries.
